# Cavekit: Documentation Page

## Scope

A single-file (`docs.html`) documentation page with sticky sidebar navigation, deployed alongside `index.html` on the `gh-pages` branch. Contains the full Cavekit reference: overview, quick start, commands, methodology, Codex integration, skills reference, configuration, and file structure. Shares the same visual identity as the landing page. Zero dependencies, zero build step.

## Requirements

### R1: Shared Visual Identity
**Description:** The docs page must use the same design language as the landing page for a cohesive experience.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Same CSS custom properties (color palette, fonts, glassmorphism values) as landing page R1
- [ ] Same background treatment (near-black with noise texture + faint grid)
- [ ] Same font stack (display font for headings, monospace for code/annotations, system sans for body)
- [ ] Glassmorphism card and surface treatments match landing page
- [ ] `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` applied to root

### R2: Page Layout
**Description:** Three-column docs layout with sticky navigation.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Desktop (>=1024px): left sidebar (240px, sticky) + main content (flexible, max ~780px) + right sidebar (200px, sticky "On this page" TOC)
- [ ] Tablet (<1024px): left sidebar collapses to hamburger menu overlay, right sidebar hidden, main content full-width
- [ ] Mobile (<768px): full-width content, hamburger nav menu

### R15: Accessibility

- [ ] Keyboard-navigable: all nav items, links, buttons, and the filter input reachable via Tab
- [ ] Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- [ ] `aria-current="true"` on the active scrollspy nav item
- [ ] Hamburger menu is a `<button>` with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`
- [ ] Filter input has an associated `<label>` (can be visually hidden)
- [ ] Skip-to-content link for keyboard users
- [ ] Heading hierarchy: h1 (page title) → h2 (sections) → h3 (subsections), no skips

### R16: Performance
**Description:** The docs page must load fast.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Single `docs.html` file — all CSS inline in `<style>`, all JS inline in `<script>`
- [ ] Total file size under 80KB (uncompressed) — more content than landing page, but still lean
- [ ] No external dependencies except optional Google Fonts (shared with landing page, `font-display: swap`)
- [ ] JS is minimal: IntersectionObserver for scrollspy, sidebar toggle, filter function, hash management
- [ ] No images — all visuals are CSS or inline SVG

## Out of Scope
- No full-text search (filter is substring match on nav item names only)
- No JavaScript framework or build system
- No versioned docs (single version only)
- No edit-on-GitHub links
- No analytics or tracking
- Content is a reformatted presentation of existing README and skill files — no new technical writing

## Cross-References
- See also: cavekit-landing-page.md (shares visual identity system, linked from docs top bar and "Back to Home")
- Landing page R1 (Visual Identity) is the source of truth for shared design tokens
